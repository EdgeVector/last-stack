description: Hourly disk-space reclaim — prune merged/clean worktrees, sweep orphan build processes, sweep stale build caches, and purge below the disk floor. The disk-focused subset of worktree-cleanup; does not pull repos or ship code.
---

Hourly disk-space reclaim for `<WORKSPACE>`. Runs unattended every hour — make
safe choices, never block on questions, end with a one-paragraph report of what
was reclaimed and current free space (`df -h`).

This is the DISK-FOCUSED subset of the `worktree-cleanup` routine: do NOT pull
repos to latest, do NOT enumerate/archive sessions, do NOT file cards. Just
reclaim disk safely.

## Automation memory
If the scheduled prompt includes an `Automation memory:` path, read and write
that exact file. Otherwise use
`${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/automations/<automation-id>/memory.md`. Before any
read/write, fail loudly if the resolved path is empty or starts with
`/automations/`; that means the fallback was computed incorrectly.

## 🛑 Hard guardrails (violating these has caused outages — obey exactly)
- NEVER kill the process hosting your **brain/board node**. Identify it first
  (e.g. `lsof -i :<your node port>`); only ever kill an *orphan* build/server
  process that sits inside a worktree you've already confirmed is safe to remove
  AND is not your live node.
- NEVER kill an agent process. NEVER `stash`/`reset`/`checkout --` in a shared
  repo.
- NEVER remove a worktree with uncommitted changes
  (`git -C <wt> status --porcelain` non-empty) OR unique unmerged commits
  (`git -C <wt> cherry origin/<DEFAULT_BRANCH> <branch>` shows any `+`). Keep
  `salvage-*` / `tombstone-*` / `locked` worktrees.
- NEVER touch a worktree whose board card is in `doing`/`review`. Read the board
  first (`<board list command>`) and cross-check by intent.

## Procedure each run
0. **Normalize the scheduled shell.** Source the Last Stack PATH prelude and
   preflight the global CLIs before shell-heavy work:
   ```bash
   last_stack="${LAST_STACK_ROOT:-$HOME/.last-stack}"
   . "$last_stack/bin/last-stack-shell-prelude"
   "$last_stack/bin/last-stack-cli-preflight" git curl jq <board-cli>
   ```
1. **Assess.** `df -h <data volume> | tail -1`; list any build/server processes
   and confirm which one is your live brain/board node so you never touch it.
2. **Discover repo roots before any repo-level Git command.** The workspace
   root may be only a container directory, so do not probe it as a checkout.
   Enumerate child repos first, then run Git against each repo:
   ```bash
   workspace="<WORKSPACE>"
   find "$workspace" -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 3 -type d -name .git -prune \
     | while IFS= read -r git_dir; do
         repo="${git_dir%/.git}"
         git -C "$repo" rev-parse --show-toplevel
       done
   ```
   Use those repo roots to enumerate worktrees across all repos + all worktree
   locations via `git -C "$repo" worktree list --porcelain`; derive each one's
   repo from `git -C <path> rev-parse --git-common-dir`.
3. **Per worktree, compute** branch, unique-commit count, dirty count, and
   whether a live process runs in it. A worktree is REMOVABLE only if 0 unique
   commits AND clean AND its card isn't `doing`/`review`. If it has a live orphan
   process (verify its command path is inside the worktree and it is NOT your
   node), kill that PID first, then `git worktree remove --force <path>` and
   `git branch -D <branch>`. Then `git worktree prune` per repo. Remove a now-
   empty worktree parent dir.
3a. **Reap stale dev-server port orphans (port-scoped, brain-safe).** A preview /
   dev server (Vite, a per-app dev node) whose launching session died can outlive
   it and keep holding its port, blocking the next run. For each known
   preview/dev-server port (`lsof -ti :<port>` for each of your
   `<preview/dev-server ports>`), check each listener's full command line
   (`ps -o command= -p <pid>`) and kill a PID ONLY if (a) it matches your
   preview/dev-server launch pattern (the `run.sh` / `vite` invocation) AND (b) it
   is NOT your live brain/board node (confirm by the node's own socket / data dir
   via `lsof <your node socket>` or `lsof -i :<your node port>`, NEVER by binary
   name — uptime is not an orphan signal). Skip any whose session is still alive
   or whose cwd is a `doing`/`review` worktree. Log each PID + port reaped.
4. **Prevention.** Sweep stale build caches older than a few days (e.g. a
   `cargo sweep`/`go clean`/`node_modules` prune equivalent for your stack).
   Confirm any incremental-build cache cap is in effect; note it if not (don't
   change global env unattended).
5. **Disk floor.** If free space < `<your floor, e.g. ~30 GB>`, proactively purge
   the largest reclaimable build-cache dir with an **atomic swap** so an active
   build doesn't see a half-deleted tree: `mv target target.PURGE` → recreate an
   empty `target/` → `rm -rf target.PURGE` in the background. Stop active
   compiles first (kill the compiler processes, NOT the node). Never blow away a
   shared build cache while you're still above the floor.

## Output
Report: GB reclaimed, worktrees pruned (and which were kept and why), final free
space, and anything left for a human.
